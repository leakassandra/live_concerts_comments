ct_12,@kingdiamond5840,2018-09-04T03:41:04+00:00,"17 days, 4:46:05","Thanks for sharing! Great mix... superb bass. It's incredibly rare to find a good Satyricon live mix. I really enjoyed this show, unlike the audience of apparent quadriplegics."
ct_13,@MasterOfWash,2018-08-29T20:41:24+00:00,"11 days, 21:46:25","Dayyyyuuum, Satyr's vocal performance deteriorated dramatically over the years."

ct_20,@trekkspellbossen482,2018-08-23T14:58:46+00:00,"5 days, 16:03:47","Thanks for streaming this. Well shot Satyricon shows are hard to find for some reason, so this made my day. Great show. The crowd was pretty lame, but Satyricon put on a great show, and played tight as hell. Respect for these guys. Rock on!!"

ct_28,@infamousleviathan9693,2018-08-20T17:54:34+00:00,"2 days, 18:59:35","the only sad thing is that their booking (and so do others) do not understand that this festival is more about well being a festival...it is not about music and that¬¥s why the fucking crowd always, as a whole, does not appreciate the gigs. As always some do, but ""some"" is not a crowd... most terrible thing was Wardruna last year...that is like booking Absurd for the next csd -.-"
