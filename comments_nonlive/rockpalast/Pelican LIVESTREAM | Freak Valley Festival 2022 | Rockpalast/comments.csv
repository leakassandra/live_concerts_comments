Primitive Man has given me the strength......or taken away my common sense. Who knows?...........who cares?That's right. Nobody.

The more I listen/watch this, the more I appreciate the performance.  This would make a great live album.  Blowing the power out...just another Pelican show."
ct_15,@hyd-satade,2022-06-17T04:26:29+00:00,5:17:59,"I always thought its extra impressive that they can sound so perfect, considering the added pressure of not having a vocalist covering up the instruments.  Just an extraordinary sound of balance from them every time."

ct_19,@TonyRedgrave1501,2022-06-16T23:23:53+00:00,0:15:23,I think the bassist Bryan Herweg created earthquakes around the festival area and the whole area around Siegen. Really great show!
