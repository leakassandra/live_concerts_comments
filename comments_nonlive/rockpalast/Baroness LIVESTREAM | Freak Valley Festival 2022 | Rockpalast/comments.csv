I've seen plenty of bands, the show was the most fun I've had so far. I strongly recommend diving into the Red/Blue record and seeing these guys live. BARONESS!"
ct_28,@christopheryanik9430,2022-06-16T20:23:07+00:00,21:28:39,"I think I've seen just about every Baroness Youtube video. This one just slays them all! Much more energy, obviously having fun and they are spot on as usual. Fun to see more and more people applauding the more songs they play. They seemed to win over a lot more fans here. Ripping show!"

ct_31,@TrulyStucker,2022-06-16T13:58:36+00:00,15:04:08,"I appreciate free music streaming, but one thing I can not understand.. it's 2022 and WDR still posts 720p low bitrate quality video.I mean, it would be cutting edge stream quality 15 years ago, but not today. Is it possible to convert videos in higher bitrate (at least 10/15mb/s | 1080p)? Once again, I appreciate everything you're doing as free on youtube, but just think about it :)"

The band seems to be having a blast, which is great to see, and they sound the best they ever have with this lineup.  The energy during their most recent American tour sucked shit (at least at the Boston show), so I'm glad they're getting a better reception with the festival circuit."
