The guy just ruins the atmosphere with his narcissistic attention wanting demeanor. Saw them three times, two with Sean and those were great until he showed up on stage. Total mismatch with the vibe of Brant and the rest. Just leave the guy at home. I come for Brant Bjork, not Wheeler. Don‚Äôt care what kind of dessert wizzard hero he is to some people."
