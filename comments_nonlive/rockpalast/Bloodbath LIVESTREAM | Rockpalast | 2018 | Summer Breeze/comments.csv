ct_2,@dimassetiawansantoso4727,2018-08-20T04:32:43+00:00,"1 day, 5:44:51",in my opinion nick is lack of evil aura & powerless in his voice (compared to akerfeldt)bring back akerfeldt......
ct_3,@CarcPazu,2018-08-20T04:19:26+00:00,"1 day, 5:31:34","Woo, Holmes voice is powerless here. Something is off. Also I don't like the set list, only one song from The Fathomless Mastery. I don't think I'd be happy if I paid to see this."
ct_4,@deathdoomdarkness6124,2018-08-20T04:11:31+00:00,"1 day, 5:23:39",I prefer Nick's work in Paradise Lost over his work in Bloodbath. Love both bands.

ct_14,@scheibengucker_chris,2018-08-19T19:58:50+00:00,21:10:58,The sound of this stream is crap compared to the live sound I witnessed in front of the stage. Heavy as fuck and Nick´s vocals sounded great for the first time. I am absolutely no fan of him doing the vocals in bloodbath but yesterday was great
ct_15,@baalieel,2018-08-19T19:56:39+00:00,21:08:47,I miss when Bloodbath was a death metal band... before this dude joined

ct_34,@nemular1,2018-08-19T02:25:15+00:00,3:37:23,What is going on with the mix.  It is possible the guitars were unplugged?  Good to see them (Blakkheim)still playing live.
ct_35,@d3nGu3,2018-08-19T01:37:16+00:00,2:49:24,This is more than cringeworthy (Nick Holmes this one goes to you!) and why is a deaf person allowed to be in charge of the mix?
