Yes Mike Patton is so ""versatile"" (ie: contrived and cheesy) maybe he should be gigging with a cover band in Vegas or something. He ruined Faith No More and Tomahawk recordings could be incredible if the vocals were erased and/or replaced."

However, they were extremely arrogant, and the mood was more than a bit spoiled. Check 36:50. I think they cut out the most embarassing part, where the frontman walks off stage, threatening to abort the show. That's what you get when continuously calling the audience Fuckers. I mean, insulting not like Slipknot who lovingly ""insult"" their fans. I mean in a contemptous, sneering way. Folks had tons of money on them, this is in 2009, before you ere forced to buy your drink with digital cash on a festival, and it was the last show. There was a moment when it was raining coins onto the stage. Folks were like ""you insult us, we keep throwing coins at you"". Very unprofessional, pathetic reaction from the band. It didn't ruin the festival of course, but instead of leaving upbeat and in a good mood everybody from our group there was kind of happy it was over after this."
