ct_7,@joeykkwong6781,2025-04-19T12:48:18+00:00,"119 days, 17:15:18","that is sad since china was the economic engine of growth for the world, but the financial crisis in 2008 and the global pandemic in 2019 created a great reset in china growth strategy. plus the economic threat of the USA sanctions in the 2018 and also now 2025,  China growth is facing major hurdles and the real estate market recession has not really helped boost china economic growth as expected. as the economic ties between china and the western nations becomes more challenging and stifled, china needs new business partners across the world to keep growing its economy. the sad part is china overpopulation, heavy competition and current slow growth has impacted with youth population in terms of career growth aspects in the country and abroad. i belief that china to keep its youth workforce employed must expand trade with developing nations and expand its youth employment globally to other developing nations in partnership with china to help resolve the growing crisis of youth employment, similar to the christian missionaries in the 1900-2000 century. of course this means young talents in china must be willing to migrate to foreign nations and leave family members behind in china, that will be the biggest challenges in china history for the future generations."

ct_34,@theunknowncorps22,2025-02-25T10:02:06+00:00,"66 days, 14:29:06","The only reason these issues are happening in China is because it adopted capitalist elements into its economy from 1978 onwards (with variation over the decades). This is why there is unemployment in the first place because there is a reserve army of labour that's left out of work because it isn't 'profitable' to hire them all. All the positive elements like strong growth, real wage increases, poverty reduction, harsh anti-corruption measures etc. are because of party- state initiative and socialist elements that remain. If it was a neoliberal economy (like US) it would be even worse."

I suspect the two graduates could both get some form of full employment but that low wage dead end job they rather than take. In that sense its not that different from many economies in the West- although the dead-end jobs would pay better.

You simply don't matter to them. As for reporting on the issue: of course there's always someone who falls out of the cracks. The question isn't whether they've fallen, but whether there are opportunities for them to rise again. If they are able to study again, after failing to get a job in their current education, then I don't really see the problem as being much worse than practically every western country.Journalism especially is a really difficult profession to land a job in. Everywhere. Not just in cenorship-heavy China. But everywhere on the planet practically. People aren't paying for news as much, not like in paper days, and advertising revenue is down.

If you study the history of China, the CCP has fallen into the same trap that led to the fall of previous Imperial Dynasties. They have fallen out of touch with the people. Their government prints lies about how everything is peachy keen. Most recently they claimed that business growth is up by 5%. Given how their economy is imploding, this can't possibly be true.Millions of Chinese citizens hold toxic mortgages for properties that were never completed by developers and/or were substantially overvalued. Some of these properties were also tofu dreg projects that were built with substandard materials in violaton of the law. Home owners have not had their concerns addressed by the government.In recent years, between 2022 and 2023, some 600,000 account holders lost their savings from by bank embezzlements and fraud schemes that were perpetrated by four rural banks in Henan province. Some 40 billion yuan ($8.5 billion) was lost. Although these accounts were supposed to have been insured by the government, reimbursement to the account holders was not forthcoming because the government decided that this was a civil matter and not the fault of the bank.Every major developer in China has gone into bankruptcy. Many of these companies were over leveraged. The failure of these developers has had a ripple effect throughout the economy affecting other businesses like steel producers and furniture makers.Although the government says that they want foreign investment, they tell their citizens that foreigners are not to be trusted. New security laws have made it easier for the government to seize intellectual property and to detain foreigners. Regulations are constantly changing which makes it difficult for businesses to operate.Fresh water supplies have been contaminated by pollution and nothing is being done to address this problem. Those water supplies which remain relatively clean have been unevenly distributed. Approximately 80% of China’s freshwater resources are located in the south, while the north, which is home to major cities and industrial centers, suffers from limited water availability. For instance, the JingJinJi region (Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei) has an annual per capita water availability below 184 cubic meters, which far below the threshold for water scarcity.China has serious issues but the CCP insists that everything is fine. The government elites have the best of everything while the poor suffer and the increasingly bad economy erodes the middle class. Things have gotten so bad that some government employees haven't been paid in months!Back in the 90's, the government reached out to many families that had left China. They offered to return our confiscated property if we woud only return to the motherland. Nobody in my family thought that this would be a good idea. Nothing over the past three decades has changed my mind regarding the quality of life in China."

The problem isnt even unique to China tho cause both countries Im a citizen to have the same problem. These are problems greatly tied to the global economic machine, inequality is only widening worldwide. Perhaps it is time we ALL reconsider what systems we are working towards and how possible concepts might work in practical applicationsIdk im in my mid 20s and co sider myself hopeful for the good days to vome, but sometimes cant help in feeling the overwhelming anxieties of how deep and fast its all heading downhill.

It is irrelevant if anyone is part of the 'elite' through educatio, if they chose a major that doesn't convert well to employability then the education wasn't a good match for the job market. (I am a proponent that education for educations sake IS worth it, but one can't then complain that the knowledge acquired isn't bringing in a salary.)I don't think that this young man was necessarily your best example. Presenting his case up as an example of how (in your estimate) China is failing doesn't hold up well. As a journalism major he probably had classes in digital marketing. He may have to choose a solopreneur path.p.s. I also checked on the statement that a cup of coffee costs $6 in Beijing. That is a little over 40 yuan. Google tells me that Starbucks charges 41 yuan. But coffes starts from 7 yuan at fast food places to 20-30 for a better coffee. It is unfair to quote the highest price available and imply that it is THE going price across the city."

One can start business with little capital as many online platforms allow small businesses to sell their products with low capital. My company buys lots of materials from China and I am so happy to see so many young people that are employed by the companies in China. They are smart, very hardworking (no complaints of overtime and working weekends) and willing to learn. How to find these young and hard working workers in France or Germany? Haha!

The market and competition is too big, so not everybody get what they want thru this harss competition.Trust me, there's actually a SHORTAGE of workers for more simple jobs and office jobs, but youngsters nowadays won't take any of those hardworking and time consuming jobs; a lot of them would rather keep studying for a master/phd or just keep waiting for another year to see if they get an oportunity while living with their parents.This documentary is framing this issue as if were exclusive to China, when in fact its a global phenomenom. Like literally, just change the name of the people and country and you would have another credible documentary done about ""youth having a hard time to find an ideal job"".Nobody wants to work as a delivery man/ at mcdonalds/ a 40+ hours boring office job that has nothing to do with their studies that took 20+ years of blood and sweat."

ct_479,@VinaVC,2024-12-21T08:46:21+00:00,13:13:21,"There's a reason why European and American journalists are generally barred from reporting in China. The news reporting submitted for international diffusion and consumption is generally biased and often taken from a negative perspective without much in-depth research and actual ""lengthy"" fieldwork.   I've been involved in the tourism business when China first opened up its doors to the world in the 1980's and I worked to promote China to the BENELUX region.  I have first-hand experience in China's gradual rise from the 1980's to now.  ARTE's reporting from the German and French side should be more balanced.  China was applauded by the World Bank for its poverty alleviation drive lifting 800 million people out of the poverty status from 2012 to 2022.  800 million people is more than the population of both France and Germany put together. Remember that.   Now, considering the global pandemic from December 2019 to January 2023 and when restriction to international travel and flight was lifted, we should all realise that companies all around the world, including China, France and Germany, that provide jobs to people were all hit hard during the 3-4 years pandemic devastation to businesses.  How can you expect jobs to be easily available to the youth when there's still a recovery process -- 2023 was only last year?  Do you think companies can recover that fast and provide necessary jobs within a one year period?  Most companies have had to file for bankruptcy. Youth dissolution with the job market is a global problem -- your focus should not only be on China.  Perhaps ARTE's reporters should look into their own backyard and neighbourhood of France and Germany and give us an example of how French and Germany youths are facing job and future security given the current condition of both European countries economies.  China is, frankly, doing well, considering my regular trips to it to monitor the agriculture and fisheries industries as well as the culture creative industries, and will continue to do better.  The tremendous task of managing the livelihood, food security and health of the Chinese people, all 1+ billion of them, will always be a responsibility of the Chinese government and they take it seriously."

DRUGGING AND RAPING ASIAN CHILDREN!The Philippine-American War pitted one time allies in the overthrow of Spain against each other. Spain negotiated a separate peace with the United States in the Treaty of Paris, ceding colonial rule of the Philippine Islands to the Americans rather than granting the Filipinos independence. The American government accepted this new imperial role, and set about subduing any Filipinos who resisted. In this scene, the city of Iloilo is captured from Filipino forces by Americans led by Brigadier General Marcus Miller, with no loss of American lives. (Diorama in the Ayala Museum, Makati, Philippines, 2018.)Waging the American WarHow did the Americans justify their takeover of the Philippines? Are you convinced by this argument?In your opinion, did American conduct during the war match these justifications? Why or why not?How did the American military attempt to counter rumors of their brutality?Annexation of the Philippines as a colony of the United States was often justified by those in the U.S. government and media on moral and racial grounds. The U.S. was simply doing its duty as an advanced, Western nation, spreading civilization, democracy, and capitalism to primitive Asians who enjoyed none of these things and were too simple to be trusted with self-government. Historian Stuart Creighton Miller writes that in this view, “Americans altruistically went to war with Spain to liberate Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and Filipinos from their tyrannical yoke. If they lingered on too long in the Philippines, it was to protect the Filipinos from European predators waiting in the wings for an American withdrawal and to tutor them in American-style democracy.” Implicit in this attitude were notions of racial superiority and the inherent superiority of white America over primitive people of color.The ugly reality of Americans colonial mission was laid bare by Dean Worcester, an American colonial official, who wrote in his memoirs that the Filipinos were “treacherous, arrogant, stupid and vindictive, impervious to gratitude, incapable of recognizing obligations. Centuries of barbarism have made them cunning and dishonest. We cannot safely treat them as equals, for the simple and sufficient reason that they could not understand it. They do not know the meaning of justice and good faith. They do not know the difference between liberty and license…. These Filipinos must be taught obedience and be forced to observe, even if they cannot comprehend, the practices of civilization.On February 11, 1899—only one week after the first shots of the war were fired—American naval forces destroyed the city of Iloilo with bombardment by the USS Petrel and the USS Baltimore. The city was then captured by ground forces led by Brigadier General Marcus Miller, with no loss of American lives.Months later, after finally securing Manila from Filipino control, American forces moved northwards, engaging in combat at the brigade and battalion level in pursuit of the fleeing insurgent forces and their commanders. In response to the use of guerilla warfare tactics by Filipino forces beginning in September 1899, American military strategy shifted to a suppression footing. Tactics became focused on the control of key areas with internment and segregation of the civilian population in “zones of protection” from the guerrilla population (foreshadowing the Strategic Hamlet Program that would be utilized decades later, during the Vietnam War). Due to unsanitary conditions, many of the interned civilians died from dysentery.General Otis gained notoriety for some of his actions in the Philippines. Although multiple orders were given to Otis from Washington to avoid military conflict, he did very little to prevent the breakout of war. Otis refused to accept anything but unconditional surrender from the Philippine Army. He often made major military decisions without first consulting leadership in Washington. He acted aggressively in dealing with the Filipinos under the assumption that their resistance would collapse quickly.A member of the American colonial government offered an alternative theory on what Bell was achieving, noting in his official report that far from breaking the spirit of the Filipino people, the blanket policy of violence and destruction was:… sowing the seeds for a perpetual revolution. If these things need be done, they had best be done by native troops so that the people of the U.S.. will not be credited therewith.Otis also played a large role in suppressing information about American military tactics from the media. When letters describing American atrocities reached the American media, the War Department became involved and demanded that Otis investigate their authenticity. Each press clipping was forwarded to the original writer’s commanding officer, who would then convince or force the soldier to write a retraction of the original statements.Meanwhile, Otis claimed that Filipino insurgents tortured American prisoners in “fiendish fashion.” During the closing months of 1899, Aguinaldo attempted to counter Otis’ account by suggesting that neutral parties—foreign journalists or representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross—inspect his military operations. Otis refused, but Aguinaldo managed to smuggle four reporters—two English, one Canadian, and one Japanese—into the Philippines. The correspondents returned to Manila to report that American captives were “treated more like guests than prisoners,” were “fed the best that the country affords, and everything is done to gain their favor.” The story went on to say that American prisoners were offered commissions in the Filipino army and that three had accepted. The four reporters were expelled from the Philippines as soon as their stories were printed.U.S. Navy Lieutenant J.C. Gilmore, whose release was forced by American cavalry pursuing Aguinaldo into the mountains, insisted that he had received “considerable treatment” and that he was no more starved than were his captors. Otis responded to publication of two articles concerning this by ordering the “capture” of the two authors, and that they be “investigated,” therefore questioning their loyalty.When F.A. Blake of the International Committee of the Red Cross arrived at Aguinaldo’s request, Otis kept him confined to Manila, where Otis’ staff explained all of the violations of international humanitarian law perpetrated by Filipino soldiers. Blake managed to slip away from an escort and venture into the field. Blake never made it past American lines, but even within American lines he saw burned out villages and “horribly mutilated bodies, with stomachs slit open and occasionally decapitated.” Blake waited to return to San Francisco, where he told one reporter that “American soldiers are determined to kill every Filipino in sight.”H.L. Wells, a staunch imperialist writing in the New York Evening Post, excused the troubling American racial theories that contributed to the often callous violence that characterized the Philippine-American War “There is no question that our men do ‘shoot niggers’ somewhat in the sporting spirit, but that is because war and their environments have rubbed off the thin veneer of civilization…Undoubtedly, they do not regard the shooting of Filipinos just as they would the shooting of white troops. This is partly because they are “only niggers,” and partly because they despise them for their treacherous servility…The soldiers feel they are fighting with savages, not with soldiers.”"
