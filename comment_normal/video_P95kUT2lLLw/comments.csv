Haven't done anything and I go back to school next week...Finals are starting on the 2nd of june for me, which may seem like a long time to prepare. But I live in Belgium and our university level of education is well...wild in my opinion. I have 2 group works but for the rest my whole grade depends on this one exam. This sucks so bad bcs I really struggle with anxiety induced black outs. I have 5 exams in 14 days which in Belgium is crazy so yay for me. I hope I can pick myself up as I really feel the need to be productive but just can't get myself to it. I have deleted instagram already and will now probably now delete youtube as well as that is easily accessible via my laptop as well. I put a lock or kinda block on instagram on my laptop, BCS WHY AM I SCROLLING REELS ON MY LAPTOP I'm so ashamed lmao. But hey this video helped me realize I need to get up and work bcs I gotta make my parents proud and more importantly myself:))"
