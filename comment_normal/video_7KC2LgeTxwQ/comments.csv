This money can be confiscated as aid to Ukraine and used to produce tanks, military equipment and military cars that require a lot of steel. The production will create jobs and boost the economies of Europe and Great Britain."

ct_13,@MatS-iy5qd,2025-04-04T19:25:30+00:00,2:14:58,It's infuriating than the reasonable approach will make Trump seems like the winner. It will cost us a lot but this is an opportunity to cut ties with the USA hegemony and grow our own solutions especially in the tech industries. Can't we make deals with China?

ct_15,@StrongKickMan,2025-04-04T18:06:31+00:00,0:55:59,The U.S always had the best deal in the world.That is the reason why they became the richest nation.Now the world sees how unrealible the U.S is. That plus the lost of trust in U.S weapons will shuffle the world of trade around.I feel save to say that the U.S will be off worse when all of this settled.
