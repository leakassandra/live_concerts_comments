Video Description:
In Hungary, the municipality of the capital city Budapest is ecologist, europhile and therefore poles apart from Viktor Orban's extreme right populist government. For the city, which is already in economic difficulty, the lower allocated funds by the State is a political move against all those who oppose those in power.
