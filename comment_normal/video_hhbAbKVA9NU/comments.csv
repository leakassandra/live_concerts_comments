Everything, what was centre left in the past time moved to extreme left, wokist, neomarxist! So calling Orb√°n far right nothing else, just the distorted view of the neoliberal mainstream. But dont worry, Trump will shake you back to your place, libs..."
ct_5,@Fischer024,2025-01-28T22:00:54+00:00,"4 days, 2:57:54","And by the way the fake opposition parties were partly allowed to win in Budapest because on the one hand it is more difficult to rig the elections in the capital were the regime has a much weaker social base and they don't even need to directly control Budapest in order to have a grip on most of the gerrymandered - usually poor, rural, easily controllable - constituencies on the national ""elections"". On the other hand, local authorites were stripped off from most of their autonomy anyway, so this situation absolutely fits the regime, that for now is interested in a softer form of autocratic rule."
ct_6,@Fischer024,2025-01-28T18:14:49+00:00,"3 days, 23:11:49","From a historical perspective, democracy has very little to no traditions in Hungary. Apart from a short period from the liberation from the semi-feudal, ultrareactionary, antisemitic, Nazi-collaborator regime in 1945 and the Stalinist takeover in 1948/49, it had two decades of - ultimately failed - experimentation with democracy ( but thanks to which it was able to join the EU in 2004 ) between 1989 and 2010/11, when Orban and his clique have started to lay down the foundations of their autocratic regime, based on models found in the various successor states of the former USSR or Turkey. And they did it - ""overhaul"" of the judiciary, introduction of a distorted, rigged electoral system, crushing critical media and even unilaterally replacing the constitution - without any meaningful opposition. Most people -very weakly educated in politics, history and stuffs like that - cannot even grasp the basic concepts of democracy, the rule of law etc. and the official oppositon parties - basically Orban's collaborators - spinelessly assisted all that, so they can run on the fake elections for their personal financial gain ( salaries as members of the fake parliament, public subsidies for the ""parliamentary"" parties and the bonus prize: getting to Strasbourg into the European Parliament... ). The newest ""opposition"" figure comes straight from the inner-circle of the regime with his one-man ""party"" as someone who apparently lost favor and trying to position himself as a potential successor of the aging Orban. And the lot of idiots believe, he will single-handedly restore democracy after winning in the framework of the fake electoral system, that is currently in place. In order to win, he has chance only in one case: if in a ""post-Orban"" situation he manages to win the support of enough inner-circle members/oligarchs of the regime. So the next autocrat following Orban could already be on his way, while in a society in which about 1 percent of the adult population is engaged in a political party ( a democratically organized one with real membership, not a one-man show, fake party with a fanatical fan base ) and less than 10 percent of the workforce is unionized, the chances of a democratic development is about just that... Sadly many countries are just not mature enough for democracy, due to their level of socio-economic development and Hungary according to how things stand historically and currently is one of them."
