ct_51,evkin,2022-06-18 21:02:43.338764,21:52,"@Dampf-Gerry The Black Keys? na klar, sind ja sowieso sehr bekannt. Rival sons wurde mir schon Ã¶fters vorgeschlagen, aber da hab ich noch nicht reingehÃ¶rt."

ct_105,Marduk1813,2022-06-18 21:20:50.172468,39:59,@Bill Riddle Damn that would be great. My only complaint about their current style is that they dont do anymore albums like their first one anymore :grinning_face_with_sweat:
