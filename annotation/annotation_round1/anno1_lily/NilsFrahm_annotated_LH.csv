ct_108;nf_ct_59;Lizbeth Ajuria;oh, thank you so much. I'll look for it! :folded_hands::smiling_face:;x;;;x;;
ct_109;nf_ct_60;AlessioAndres;i don't understand why layered sounds are considered as music.;;x;x;;;
ct_110;nf_ct_61;AlessioAndres;this is pathetic;;x;;;;
ct_111;nf_ct_62;Alex;grow up alessio;;x;;;;
ct_113;nf_ct_63;Alex;this man has more talent in his eyelashes than you or your family ever will;;x;;;;

ct_116;nf_ct_66;Lizbeth Ajuria;It's ok dear Alessio, chill out. us, we love his music! :face_blowing_a_kiss::folded_hands::sparkling_heart:;x;x;;;;
ct_118;nf_ct_67;blue_scape;So all ambient/chill music is no music? ;;;;x;;
ct_121;nf_ct_68;Niets Music;Leave synthdaddy alone Alessio;x;x;;;;
ct_122;nf_ct_69;Alex;why are you still here @AlessioAndres ;;x;;;;
ct_123;nf_ct_70;kostas Logothetis;:red_heart:;x;;;;;
ct_125;nf_ct_71;Stan 103;haha, Alessio trying to liven up this chat a little - and it's working :slightly_smiling_face:;x;;;;;
ct_126;nf_ct_72;franconicotom;he is using a couple of line array and gigant subwoofers as monitors wow thats too much;;x;x;;;
ct_127;nf_ct_73;Alex;talk to Brian Eno you nonce;;x;;x;;
ct_128;nf_ct_74;Alex;or Harrold Burris Meyer;;;;x;;
ct_130;nf_ct_75;Stan 103;build up and harmonics are part of music too and this Nils guy is very goot at that;x;;x;;;
ct_131;nf_ct_76;Stan 103;goot :disappointed_face: good :slightly_smiling_face:;x;x;;;;
ct_133;nf_ct_77;Niets Music;Might not be music to you, but I like it :man_shrugging:;x;;;;;
ct_134;nf_ct_78;momø;aleesio how about you try layering sounds and they all happen to be in that kind of aether harmony.Your comments just shows how little you know about music as a technical matter and as a soul food 2;;x;x;;;
ct_136;nf_ct_79;Myridean Prime;Talent is the distinction when layering different harmonics between cacophony and musical bliss.;;;;x;;
ct_137;nf_ct_80;Alex;@franconicotom those aren't subs as monitors... and line arrays are pretty common in shows lol wtf you talking about;;x;;x;;
ct_138;nf_ct_81;Niets Music;Give me your layered shit synthdaddy :sweat_droplets::drooling_face:;x;;x;;;
ct_141;nf_ct_82;momø;there is no structure between your ears you cant just get bunch of sounds layer them as you wish and it magically fill whole arenas why dudes like u shit in live chats for no reason;;x;;x;;
ct_142;nf_ct_83;Gautier Milewski;:clapping_hands:;x;;;;;
ct_144;nf_ct_84;Alex;correction, he might have two small subs as a part of the monitors which makes sense... he doesn't have IEMs or headphones and wants to feel / hear what he's playing... don't know what the big deal is;;;x;x;;
ct_146;nf_ct_85;Alex;really alessio we thought you were here to talk shit about how this isn't music;;x;;;;
ct_147;nf_ct_86;Alex;but go on;;;;;;
ct_148;nf_ct_87;Abigail Lichtenstein;WOOWWWWW SO happy that I randomly catched this livestreammmm amazing ;x;;;;;
ct_151;nf_ct_88;Martin Vlas;ignore him and enjoy the music;;;;;;
ct_152;nf_ct_89;Andrew Raymond (AR Productions);A pretentious tool in the comment section of a Nils Frahm video. I'm shocked;;x;;;;
ct_153;nf_ct_90;Abe 901;Alessio, if you don't like, that's because it's not for you. Silly boy. Bon vent!;;x;;;;
ct_155;nf_ct_91;Niets Music;"Alessio when synthdaddy noodles on the piano which qualifies as ""real music"" to him: :drooling_face:";;x;;;;
ct_156;nf_ct_92;Travler Nils;classic mixed with modern electronic :red_heart: ;x;;;;;
ct_157;nf_ct_93;Alex;line arrays are used in clubs and theaters all the time, not just stadiums. ;;;;x;;
ct_158;nf_ct_94;Mikołaj Dawidczyk;love you all thx for this concert <3;x;;;;;
ct_159;nf_ct_95;Mini Mean;this is just wonderful. danke, thx and merci nils and arte.;x;;;;;
ct_160;nf_ct_96;Travler Nils;I went to one of Nils shows... Great sound :grinning_face: ;x;;x;;;
ct_162;nf_ct_97;Alex;and yes there are some subs under the wedges that i didn't see at first :);;;;x;;

ct_165;nf_ct_99;Gautier Milewski;So grateful this exists! Merci Arte;x;;;;;
ct_167;nf_ct_100;kelly vandevenne;Lovely concert . Listening in my garden with the sound of birds as backing vocals :winking_face:;x;;;x;;
ct_168;nf_ct_101;Alex;also looks like there are 4 boxes stacked on some subs for the line array, not super overkill for an electronic show in a concert hall tbh;;;;x;;
ct_169;nf_ct_102;Epi..mű;cheers :clinking_glasses:👊🏼 ., it'll be the soundtrack for a long soak in the bath l8rz., :musical_notes:🛀🏼:dashing_away::winking_face:👍🏼;x;;;x;;
ct_170;nf_ct_103;Travler Nils;Im sure its nice sound in that concert hall;x;;x;;;
ct_171;nf_ct_104;AlessioAndres;music is everything that is not sound where sound is present. i am listening to music like a person without hearing and no concept of emotion would. there's stories, someone enters, approaches by -;;;;x;;

ct_178;nf_ct_108;sato2097;That mixing console alone costs more than 100k;;;;x;;
ct_180;nf_ct_109;AlessioAndres;"music is an intellectual thing, not a coloured drink with an umbrella to be ""liked.""";x;;;x;;
ct_182;nf_ct_110;Travler Nils;@Apoptose Records I saw him in Uppsala, sweden... Great show :red_heart: ;x;;x;;;
ct_184;nf_ct_111;Focusbill;thanks @ARTE Concert ;x;;;;;
ct_185;nf_ct_112;Gautier Milewski;@AlessioAndres you can choose to have your own personal definition of music, but you can't impose it on everyone else and exclude whole genres;;;;x;;
ct_186;nf_ct_113;Andrew Raymond (AR Productions);"@AlessioAndres Leonard Bernstein once put a cigarette out on my neck... i think i know what ""real"" music is";;;;x;;
ct_188;nf_ct_114;sato2097;then I see multiple Roland re-501 that cost like 2k to 3k a piece and need constant servicing;;;;x;;
ct_189;nf_ct_115;Myridean Prime;Beautiful! :smiling_face_with_hearts:;x;;;;;
ct_190;nf_ct_116;KotlinTest;@ARTE Concert Thank you for this wonderful present! :red_heart::red_heart::red_heart:;x;;;;;
ct_191;nf_ct_117;DRRNNDGL;@sato2097 read somewhere he owns 20+ of them total;;;;x;;
ct_194;nf_ct_118;AlessioAndres;that's what i am doing. i don't have the authority to exclude stuff anyway. :face_with_tears_of_joy: nobody holds the truth.;;;;x;;
ct_197;nf_ct_119;Epi..mű;":face_with_hand_over_mouth:fek .,¿ ""intellectual"" ., it's PURELY emotional the intellectualasing is for twats with nothing to keep themselves occupied! IMHO :winking_face_with_tongue:";;x;;x;;
ct_198;nf_ct_120;sato2097;this piece will have a drum line;;;x;;;
ct_200;nf_ct_121;sato2097;Nils Frahm was at in Berlin at the superbooth a month ago and screened parts of this video, but with access to the stems so he was able to isolate individual tracks;;;;x;;
ct_201;nf_ct_122;franconicotom;keyboard composition of Nils are just . Wow;x;;x;;;
ct_203;nf_ct_123;sato2097;you really need good speakers / monitors to fully appreciate this;x;;;;;
ct_204;nf_ct_124;Niets Music;This is my favourite piece <3;x;;x;;;
ct_205;nf_ct_125;AlessioAndres;emotion is due to chemistry. you can control sht with intellect.;;;;x;;
ct_206;nf_ct_126;Exeljion;Spells :smiling_face_with_heart_eyes:;x;;;;;
ct_207;nf_ct_127;KotlinTest;"It is ""Spells"" from the All Encores ";;;x;;;
ct_208;nf_ct_128;Niets Music;But the album version doesnt have the drums :crying_face:;;;x;;;x
ct_209;nf_ct_129;Travler Nils;Im listning on a Bang & Olufsen speaker, very rich and deep :slightly_smiling_face: ;x;;;x;;
ct_210;nf_ct_130;blue_scape;Intellect is more important than emotions? Alessio ;;;;x;;
ct_212;nf_ct_131;Epi..mű;the thought that music is audio `MATHS is ........;;x;;x;;
ct_216;nf_ct_132;AlessioAndres;your intelligence is your entire attention. intellect is the only tool for triangulating in any architecture everything available for accessing. everything.;;;;x;;
ct_217;nf_ct_133;Nicolas Briard;Arte:face-red-heart-shape:;x;;;;;
ct_219;nf_ct_134;Travler Nils;But Alessio... Everything starts with the mind. thoughts always comes first and then emotions are created. Same with intellect. Thought first, always :slightly_smiling_face: ;;;;x;;
ct_220;nf_ct_135;Niets Music;Just to imagine Alessio's mom carrying him around in her womb for 9 months just for him to end up in this comment section today to spew all this nonsense;;x;;x;;
ct_223;nf_ct_136;Niets Music;This is the best parttttt;x;;x;;;
ct_224;nf_ct_137;Alex;seems like alessio didn't get bullied enough as a kid to actually develop a personality;;x;;x;;
ct_225;nf_ct_138;Kristof Devlamynck;Thx Nils, Thx ARTE Concert :face_blowing_a_kiss:;x;;;;;

ct_244;nf_ct_154;Alex;don't get me wrong, I love Eno, but Nils has way more wellie than Eno could ever produce;x;;;x;;
ct_245;nf_ct_155;Travler Nils;No more shrooms for you Alessio;;x;;x;;
ct_246;nf_ct_156;Alex;Philip Glass is the only one that comes close that I can think of. ;;;;x;;

ct_267;nf_ct_168;Epi..mű;and we've got Nils'es old sparring mate Olafur Arnold's Kiasmos ... And I'd hope you're all fans of Pete Namlook and the `Darkside If The Moog' series...;;;;x;;
ct_268;nf_ct_169;Abe 901;Could it be a bot? I mean....;;;;x;;
ct_269;nf_ct_170;Alex;definitely not;;;;x;;
