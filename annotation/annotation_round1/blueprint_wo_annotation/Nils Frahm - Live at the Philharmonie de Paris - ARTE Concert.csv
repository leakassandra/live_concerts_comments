ct_107,blue_scape,The song is on Youtube @Lizbeth Ajuria ,,,,,,
ct_108,Lizbeth Ajuria,"oh, thank you so much. I'll look for it! :folded_hands::smiling_face:",,,,,,
ct_109,AlessioAndres,i don't understand why layered sounds are considered as music.,,,,,,
ct_110,AlessioAndres,this is pathetic,,,,,,
ct_111,Alex,grow up alessio,,,,,,
ct_113,Alex,this man has more talent in his eyelashes than you or your family ever will,,,,,,

ct_118,blue_scape,So all ambient/chill music is no music? ,,,,,,
ct_121,Niets Music,Leave synthdaddy alone Alessio,,,,,,
ct_122,Alex,why are you still here @AlessioAndres ,,,,,,
ct_123,kostas Logothetis,:red_heart:,,,,,,
ct_125,Stan 103,"haha, Alessio trying to liven up this chat a little - and it's working :slightly_smiling_face:",,,,,,
ct_126,franconicotom,he is using a couple of line array and gigant subwoofers as monitors wow thats too much,,,,,,
ct_127,Alex,talk to Brian Eno you nonce,,,,,,
ct_128,Alex,or Harrold Burris Meyer,,,,,,
ct_130,Stan 103,build up and harmonics are part of music too and this Nils guy is very goot at that,,,,,,
ct_131,Stan 103,goot :disappointed_face: good :slightly_smiling_face:,,,,,,
ct_133,Niets Music,"Might not be music to you, but I like it :man_shrugging:",,,,,,
ct_134,momø,aleesio how about you try layering sounds and they all happen to be in that kind of aether harmony.Your comments just shows how little you know about music as a technical matter and as a soul food 2,,,,,,
ct_136,Myridean Prime,Talent is the distinction when layering different harmonics between cacophony and musical bliss.,,,,,,
ct_137,Alex,@franconicotom those aren't subs as monitors... and line arrays are pretty common in shows lol wtf you talking about,,,,,,
ct_138,Niets Music,Give me your layered shit synthdaddy :sweat_droplets::drooling_face:,,,,,,
ct_141,momø,there is no structure between your ears you cant just get bunch of sounds layer them as you wish and it magically fill whole arenas why dudes like u shit in live chats for no reason,,,,,,
ct_142,Gautier Milewski,:clapping_hands:,,,,,,
ct_144,Alex,"correction, he might have two small subs as a part of the monitors which makes sense... he doesn't have IEMs or headphones and wants to feel / hear what he's playing... don't know what the big deal is",,,,,,
ct_146,Alex,really alessio we thought you were here to talk shit about how this isn't music,,,,,,
ct_147,Alex,but go on,,,,,,
ct_148,Abigail Lichtenstein,WOOWWWWW SO happy that I randomly catched this livestreammmm amazing ,,,,,,
ct_151,Martin Vlas,ignore him and enjoy the music,,,,,,
ct_152,Andrew Raymond (AR Productions),A pretentious tool in the comment section of a Nils Frahm video. I'm shocked,,,,,,
ct_153,Abe 901,"Alessio, if you don't like, that's because it's not for you. Silly boy. Bon vent!",,,,,,
ct_155,Niets Music,"Alessio when synthdaddy noodles on the piano which qualifies as ""real music"" to him: :drooling_face:",,,,,,
ct_156,Travler Nils,classic mixed with modern electronic :red_heart: ,,,,,,
ct_157,Alex,"line arrays are used in clubs and theaters all the time, not just stadiums. ",,,,,,
ct_158,Mikołaj Dawidczyk,love you all thx for this concert <3,,,,,,
ct_159,Mini Mean,"this is just wonderful. danke, thx and merci nils and arte.",,,,,,
ct_160,Travler Nils,I went to one of Nils shows... Great sound :grinning_face: ,,,,,,
ct_162,Alex,and yes there are some subs under the wedges that i didn't see at first :),,,,,,
ct_164,Lizbeth Ajuria,:pink_heart::pink_heart::pink_heart:,,,,,,
ct_165,Gautier Milewski,So grateful this exists! Merci Arte,,,,,,
ct_167,kelly vandevenne,Lovely concert . Listening in my garden with the sound of birds as backing vocals :winking_face:,,,,,,
ct_168,Alex,"also looks like there are 4 boxes stacked on some subs for the line array, not super overkill for an electronic show in a concert hall tbh",,,,,,
ct_169,Epi..mű,"cheers :clinking_glasses:👊🏼 ., it'll be the soundtrack for a long soak in the bath l8rz., :musical_notes:🛀🏼:dashing_away::winking_face:👍🏼",,,,,,
ct_170,Travler Nils,Im sure its nice sound in that concert hall,,,,,,
ct_171,AlessioAndres,"music is everything that is not sound where sound is present. i am listening to music like a person without hearing and no concept of emotion would. there's stories, someone enters, approaches by -",,,,,,
ct_172,Myridean Prime,Re :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:,,,,,,
ct_173,Travler Nils,they are not stopid ,,,,,,
ct_177,Txema ,:thanksdoc:,,,,,,
ct_178,sato2097,That mixing console alone costs more than 100k,,,,,,
ct_180,AlessioAndres,"music is an intellectual thing, not a coloured drink with an umbrella to be ""liked.""",,,,,,
ct_182,Travler Nils,"@Apoptose Records I saw him in Uppsala, sweden... Great show :red_heart: ",,,,,,
ct_184,Focusbill,thanks @ARTE Concert ,,,,,,
ct_185,Gautier Milewski,"@AlessioAndres you can choose to have your own personal definition of music, but you can't impose it on everyone else and exclude whole genres",,,,,,
ct_186,Andrew Raymond (AR Productions),"@AlessioAndres Leonard Bernstein once put a cigarette out on my neck... i think i know what ""real"" music is",,,,,,
ct_188,sato2097,then I see multiple Roland re-501 that cost like 2k to 3k a piece and need constant servicing,,,,,,
ct_189,Myridean Prime,Beautiful! :smiling_face_with_hearts:,,,,,,
ct_190,KotlinTest,@ARTE Concert Thank you for this wonderful present! :red_heart::red_heart::red_heart:,,,,,,
ct_191,DRRNNDGL,@sato2097 read somewhere he owns 20+ of them total,,,,,,
ct_194,AlessioAndres,that's what i am doing. i don't have the authority to exclude stuff anyway. :face_with_tears_of_joy: nobody holds the truth.,,,,,,
ct_197,Epi..mű,":face_with_hand_over_mouth:fek .,¿ ""intellectual"" ., it's PURELY emotional the intellectualasing is for twats with nothing to keep themselves occupied! IMHO :winking_face_with_tongue:",,,,,,
ct_198,sato2097,this piece will have a drum line,,,,,,
ct_200,sato2097,"Nils Frahm was at in Berlin at the superbooth a month ago and screened parts of this video, but with access to the stems so he was able to isolate individual tracks",,,,,,
ct_201,franconicotom,keyboard composition of Nils are just . Wow,,,,,,
ct_203,sato2097,you really need good speakers / monitors to fully appreciate this,,,,,,
ct_204,Niets Music,This is my favourite piece <3,,,,,,
ct_205,AlessioAndres,emotion is due to chemistry. you can control sht with intellect.,,,,,,
ct_206,Exeljion,Spells :smiling_face_with_heart_eyes:,,,,,,
ct_207,KotlinTest,"It is ""Spells"" from the All Encores ",,,,,,
ct_208,Niets Music,But the album version doesnt have the drums :crying_face:,,,,,,
ct_209,Travler Nils,"Im listning on a Bang & Olufsen speaker, very rich and deep :slightly_smiling_face: ",,,,,,
ct_210,blue_scape,Intellect is more important than emotions? Alessio ,,,,,,
ct_212,Epi..mű,the thought that music is audio `MATHS is ........,,,,,,
ct_216,AlessioAndres,your intelligence is your entire attention. intellect is the only tool for triangulating in any architecture everything available for accessing. everything.,,,,,,
ct_217,Nicolas Briard,Arte:face-red-heart-shape:,,,,,,
ct_219,Travler Nils,"But Alessio... Everything starts with the mind. thoughts always comes first and then emotions are created. Same with intellect. Thought first, always :slightly_smiling_face: ",,,,,,
ct_220,Niets Music,Just to imagine Alessio's mom carrying him around in her womb for 9 months just for him to end up in this comment section today to spew all this nonsense,,,,,,
ct_223,Niets Music,This is the best parttttt,,,,,,
ct_224,Alex,seems like alessio didn't get bullied enough as a kid to actually develop a personality,,,,,,
ct_225,Kristof Devlamynck,"Thx Nils, Thx ARTE Concert :face_blowing_a_kiss:",,,,,,

ct_262,Travler Nils,I will stop feeding the fire now :slightly_smiling_face: :red_heart: ,,,,,,
ct_263,MA SC,whats wrong with him?,,,,,,
ct_265,Alex,he thinks this isn't music for starters,,,,,,
ct_266,Alex,and is still here talking shit for some reason,,,,,,
ct_267,Epi..mű,and we've got Nils'es old sparring mate Olafur Arnold's Kiasmos ... And I'd hope you're all fans of Pete Namlook and the `Darkside If The Moog' series...,,,,,,
ct_268,Abe 901,Could it be a bot? I mean....,,,,,,
ct_269,Alex,definitely not,,,,,,
ct_270,Alex,bots usually don't make grammatical errors like that,,,,,,
ct_271,Abe 901,Fair enough,,,,,,
